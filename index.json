We will explore the definitions proposed by Arrhenius, Brønsted-Lowry, and Lewis, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different chemical systems.\nSummary Acid-base chemistry is fundamental to many chemical processes. This page explores the evolution of acid-base definitions, starting with the restrictive Arrhenius theory, expanding to the more inclusive Brønsted-Lowry theory, and culminating in the broadest definition offered by Lewis. Each theory provides a framework for understanding acid-base behavior, but each also has limitations.\n1. Arrhenius Theory: A Historical Foundation 1.1. Definition Svante Arrhenius proposed the first formal definition of acids and bases in 1884. According to the Arrhenius theory:\nAcid: A substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ($H^+$) when dissolved in water. Base: A substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) when dissolved in water. Mathematically, we can represent this as follows:\n$Acid(aq) \\longrightarrow H^+(aq) + A^-(aq)$\n$Base(aq) \\longrightarrow M^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\nWhere A- represents the conjugate base of the acid and M+ represents the conjugate acid of the base.\n1.2. Examples Hydrochloric acid ($HCl$): A strong Arrhenius acid that dissociates completely in water:\n$HCl(aq) \\longrightarrow H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$\nSodium hydroxide ($NaOH$): A strong Arrhenius base that dissociates completely in water:\n$NaOH(aq) \\longrightarrow Na^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n1.3. Limitations The Arrhenius theory is limited by:\nSolvent Restriction: It applies only to aqueous solutions (water is the solvent). Proton/Hydroxide Requirement: It requires acids to donate $H^+$ and bases to donate $OH^-$. This excludes substances that exhibit acid-base behavior without these species. Exclusion of Gaseous Reactions: It cannot be applied to reactions occurring in the gas phase or in non-aqueous solvents. 2. Brønsted-Lowry Theory: Proton Transfer Dynamics 2.1. Definition Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry independently proposed a more general definition of acids and bases in 1923. Their theory focuses on proton ($H^+$) transfer:\nAcid: A substance that donates a proton ($H^+$). Base: A substance that accepts a proton ($H^+$). This definition expands the scope to non-aqueous solutions and focuses on the transfer of a proton rather than its presence in solution.\n2.2. Key Concepts Proton Donor/Acceptor: Acids are proton donors, and bases are proton acceptors. Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs: An acid and its conjugate base (formed after proton donation) or a base and its conjugate acid (formed after proton acceptance) constitute a conjugate acid-base pair. $Acid \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + Conjugate \\ Base$\n$Base + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons Conjugate \\ Acid$\n2.3. Examples Ammonia ($NH_3$) reacting with water: Ammonia acts as a Brønsted-Lowry base by accepting a proton from water:\n$NH_3(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons NH_4^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\nHere, $NH_3$ is the base, $H_2O$ is the acid, $NH_4^+$ is the conjugate acid, and $OH^-$ is the conjugate base.\nAcetic acid ($CH_3COOH$) reacting with water: Acetic acid acts as a Brønsted-Lowry acid by donating a proton to water:\n$CH_3COOH(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^-(aq) + H_3O^+(aq)$\nHere, $CH_3COOH$ is the acid, $H_2O$ is the base, $CH_3COO^-$ is the conjugate base, and $H_3O^+$ is the conjugate acid.\n2.4. Advantages over Arrhenius Theory Broader Scope: Not limited to aqueous solutions. Focus on Proton Transfer: More accurately describes acid-base behavior in many systems. 2.5. Limitations Proton Requirement: Still requires the presence and transfer of protons. This excludes reactions where acid-base behavior occurs without proton transfer. 3. Lewis Theory: Electron Pair Dynamics 3.1. Definition Gilbert N. Lewis proposed the most general definition of acids and bases in 1923. This theory focuses on electron pair interactions:\nAcid: A substance that accepts an electron pair. (Electron Pair Acceptor) Base: A substance that donates an electron pair. (Electron Pair Donor) This definition encompasses all Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases, but also includes substances that act as acids or bases without transferring protons.\n3.2. Key Concepts Electron Pair Acceptor/Donor: Lewis acids accept electron pairs, forming a coordinate covalent bond. Lewis bases donate electron pairs. Coordinate Covalent Bond: A covalent bond in which both electrons are supplied by one atom (the Lewis base). $Lewis \\ Acid + Lewis \\ Base \\longrightarrow Adduct$\n3.3. Examples Boron trifluoride ($BF_3$) reacting with ammonia ($NH_3$): $BF_3$ is a Lewis acid because it has an incomplete octet and can accept an electron pair. $NH_3$ is a Lewis base because it has a lone pair of electrons that it can donate.\n$BF_3 + NH_3 …","date":1739893382,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1739994219,"objectID":"cab5f4b4d1d975feeea710c86042d59d","permalink":"https://tsiyukino.github.io/blog/post/chemistry-index/acid-base-theories/","publishdate":"2025-02-18T10:43:02-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/chemistry-index/acid-base-theories/","section":"post","summary":"Acid-base chemistry is fundamental to many chemical processes.
