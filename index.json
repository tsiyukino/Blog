The conceptual framework for understanding acid-base interactions has evolved significantly over time, with each new theoretical model addressing limitations of its predecessors while expanding the scope of reactions that can be classified within this paradigm. This analysis examines the three predominant theoretical frameworks: Arrhenius, Brønsted-Lowry, and Lewis theories, providing a rigorous mathematical treatment of each while highlighting their interconnections and distinctive applications.\n1. Arrhenius Theory 1.1 Theoretical Foundation Svante Arrhenius proposed the first comprehensive acid-base theory in 1884, defining:\nAcids: Substances that dissociate in aqueous solution to produce hydrogen ions ($\\text{H}^+$) Bases: Substances that dissociate in aqueous solution to produce hydroxide ions ($\\text{OH}^-$) 1.2 Mathematical Formulation For an Arrhenius acid HA:\n$$\\text{HA}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{H}^+(aq) + \\text{A}^-(aq)$$\nFor an Arrhenius base BOH:\n$$\\text{BOH}(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{B}^+(aq) + \\text{OH}^-(aq)$$\nThe neutralization reaction can be represented as:\n$$\\text{H}^+(aq) + \\text{OH}^-(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l)$$\n1.3 Thermodynamic Considerations The dissociation of an Arrhenius acid or base is governed by equilibrium thermodynamics. For the acid dissociation equilibrium:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]}$$\nWhere $K_a$ is the acid dissociation constant, a direct measure of acid strength.\n1.4 Limitations While the Arrhenius theory successfully explained many acid-base reactions, it is fundamentally limited by:\nIts restriction to aqueous solutions Inability to explain the basic behavior of compounds without hydroxide ions (e.g., NH₃) The oversimplification of representing protons as free $\\text{H}^+$ ions, which actually exist as hydronium ions ($\\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+$) in aqueous solutions 2. Brønsted-Lowry Theory 2.1 Theoretical Foundation Independently developed by Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry in 1923, this theory defines:\nAcids: Proton donors Bases: Proton acceptors This definition expanded acid-base chemistry beyond aqueous solutions and introduced the concept of conjugate acid-base pairs.\n2.2 Mathematical Formulation For a general Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reaction:\n$$\\text{HA} + \\text{B} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{A}^- + \\text{HB}^+$$\nWhere:\nHA is the acid (proton donor) B is the base (proton acceptor) A⁻ is the conjugate base of HA HB⁺ is the conjugate acid of B 2.3 Quantitative Treatment The equilibrium constant for this reaction, $K_{eq}$, relates to the acid dissociation constants of the conjugate acid-base pairs:\n$$K_{eq} = \\frac{[\\text{A}^-][\\text{HB}^+]}{[\\text{HA}][\\text{B}]} = \\frac{K_a(\\text{HA})}{K_a(\\text{HB}^+)}$$\nThis relationship can be expressed logarithmically:\n$$\\log K_{eq} = pK_a(\\text{HB}^+) - pK_a(\\text{HA})$$\n2.4 Amphiprotic Substances A significant advancement of the Brønsted-Lowry theory is its ability to describe amphiprotic substances—those capable of acting as either acids or bases depending on the reaction environment. For a species H₂A:\nAs an acid: $\\text{H}_2\\text{A} + \\text{B} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{HA}^- + \\text{HB}^+$\nAs a base: $\\text{H}_2\\text{A} + \\text{HA}’ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_3\\text{A}^+ + \\text{A}’^-$\n2.5 Leveling Effect In the Brønsted-Lowry framework, the leveling effect describes the phenomenon where strong acids are “leveled” to the same acidity in a given solvent. For example, in water, any acid stronger than H₃O⁺ is leveled to the acidity of H₃O⁺:\n$$\\text{HA} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{H}_3\\text{O}^+ + \\text{A}^-$$\nFor extremely strong acids, the equilibrium lies entirely to the right, making their intrinsic acid strength indistinguishable in aqueous solution.\n3. Lewis Theory 3.1 Theoretical Foundation Proposed by G.N. Lewis in 1923, this theory provides the most general definition:\nAcids: Electron pair acceptors Bases: Electron pair donors This definition encompasses both the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions while extending to reactions where no proton transfer occurs.\n3.2 Mathematical Representation For a Lewis acid-base reaction:\n$$\\text{A} + :\\text{B} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{A}:\\text{B}$$\nWhere:\nA is the Lewis acid (electron pair acceptor) :B is the Lewis base (electron pair donor) with the lone pair represented by the colon A:B is the coordination complex formed 3.3 Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory Perspective From the perspective of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, a Lewis acid-base reaction involves the interaction between:\nThe Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the acid The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the base The energy gap between these orbitals ($\\Delta E_{\\text{HOMO-LUMO}}$) is directly related to the reactivity:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{HOMO-LUMO}} = …","date":1739893382,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740457097,"objectID":"cab5f4b4d1d975feeea710c86042d59d","permalink":"https://tsiyukino.github.io/blog/post/chemistry-index/acid-base-theories/","publishdate":"2025-02-18T10:43:02-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/chemistry-index/acid-base-theories/","section":"post","summary":"Acid-base chemistry is fundamental to many chemical processes.
